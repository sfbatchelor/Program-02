# Shader Mask

Initial experiment with openframeworks and using oil paint photographic textures. 

Overlays the .jpg files found in /bin/data folder with the shader named vert.glsl and frag.glsl which are textured to a full window plane.

/bin/data folder is not brought over so this program will likley die if you just run it - add a .jpg and a basic constant colour shader to a new /bin/data folder in the root of this project to see the effects.
